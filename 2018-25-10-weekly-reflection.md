This week we learned about booleans and reviewed code that would help us in the future. We got a worksheet that we had to complete that talked about booleans and helped us review and strengthen our coding vocabulary.

We also made bar and pie graphs for programs that showed us data in percentage and fraction form. Today we looked at google spreadsheets and pyret to compare and see the similarites and differences between different types of data. I learned how to insert a google spreadsheet into pyret. Next time I have to figure out how to see the document after getting the file uploaded.

[My Flag of Paula](/images/JELLYFAMCOLINFLAG.png/)

I had a problem with my original flag so I changed it to the Paula flag. When coding the flag I kept on getting an error about the word "solid". The problem was that I had forgotten to add a comma so the code was being mistaken for something else. When searching for a flag, I couldn't really find the exact color code for it. In the end the color still looks very similar but not exactly the same. I enjoyed this project because it helped us learn about diferent ways to code. An example of that is "overlay()" which overlaps a shape over another shape.

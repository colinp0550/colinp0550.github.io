[My Flag of Paula](/images/JELLYFAMCOLINFLAG.png/)

I had a problem with my original flag so I changed it to the Paula flag. When coding the flag I kept on getting an error about the word "solid". The problem was that I had forgotten to add a comma so the code was being mistaken for something else.

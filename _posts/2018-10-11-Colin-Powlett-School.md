This week in AP Computer Science we were mainly trying to create a flag. We picked a flag and went on Pyret to create it. We learned about the "overlay" code where it put different colors on top of each other just like a real flag does. I have been struggling in finding a good flag that is easy but a little challenging. Something that I can change is focusing in class and remembering clearly what we learned in class.

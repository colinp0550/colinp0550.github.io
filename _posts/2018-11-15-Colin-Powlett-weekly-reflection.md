Last week in Computer Science we started with an intro to structures. We learned about the contract of the function. We were taught about the name of data, the constructor, the container, and the delivery state. When we talked about data definitions we learned what each part of the code represented. An example of that is the flavor of the birthday cake. That represents the categorical string of the data. Mainly during this week we talked about an animal table. We talked about the type of data(Strings, Numbers, Boolean),what the data recongnizes, and lookup questions. One thing that I really learned from these past two weeks came from Pyret. I learned how to insert a table and how to find the different layers of code.

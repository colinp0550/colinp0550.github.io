I chose question 2 on the APCSP Midterm because I believe that it is a good question that shows properties of expressions. Question two is a novice level problem and the mastery skill is MS1. MS1 consists of using tools like functions, keywords(+,-, scale), evaluating expressions, and the application matches the contract. 

2. What is the name of the outermost function in scale(2, circle(40, "solid", "blue"))?

    (a)scale               (b)circle             (c)rectangle           (d)contract
    
Correct Answer: (A)

I am feeling pretty good about AP Computer Science. We are learning about creating our own games using a different coding website and language than last year. A struggle that I first faced was making sure that I did exactly what the instructions asked me to do. If I went off just a little bit or didn't read it carefully, it could mess up my entire code and I would have to look a every piece of code until I would find the problem. In all, everything's going pretty good so far.

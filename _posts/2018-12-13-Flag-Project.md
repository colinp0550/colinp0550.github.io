RR=rectangle(500, 300, "solid", "dark green")
YC=circle(100, "solid", "white")
BC=place-image(YC, 250, 150, RR) 
GC=circle(100, "solid", "dark green")
place-image(GC, 270, 120, BC )

A question that I asked this week is how to create an overlay. After the question was answered I realized that I could just put another place-image which would be must simpiler than overlay. A challenge was finding the right coordinates for the second circle to be placed upon. Something that I look forward to next week is finishing my flag.
